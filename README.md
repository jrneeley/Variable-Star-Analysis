Routines for the identification, classification, and simulation of variable stars.

## Classification

variable_classification.py runs an interactive window (shown above) that allows you to quickly classify candidate variable stars 
into their respective types (e.g. Classical Cepheids, RR Lyrae stars, etc.). The program plots the light curve (phased and raw) as
well as the color-magnitude diagram, period-luminosity relation, period-color relation, period-amplitude relation, and a postage stamp 
of the star on the image to help with classification. The user chooses the appropriate classification using the buttons on the right panel,
and the text file with the list of candidates is automatically updated.
